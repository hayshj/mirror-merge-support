      <h3>How do I restart a game?</h3>

      </p>

      <h3>Why am I seeing ads?</h3>
      <p>
        Mirror Merge is supported by ads. Ads help keep the app free to download
        and maintain.
      </p>

      <h3>Why aren’t ads showing?</h3>
      <p>
        Ads may not appear every time. They can also be affected by your network
        connection or ad availability in your region.
      </p>

      <h3>My high score disappeared — why?</h3>
      <p>
        High scores are stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the app
        or clear its storage, your saved score may be removed.
